# To-Do List Application

This is a simple Python console-based to-do list application that allows you to add tasks to a list, view the tasks in the list, and quit the application. It's a handy tool for keeping track of your tasks and staying organized.

## How to Use

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

2. Download the `todo_list.py` script.

3. Open your terminal or command prompt.

4. Navigate to the directory where the `todo_list.py` script is located.

5. Run the script by entering the following command:

   ```shell
   python todo_list.py
   ```

6. You will see the main menu with the following options:

   - **1. Add Task:** Allows you to add a new task to your to-do list. Simply enter the task's description when prompted.

   - **2. View Tasks:** Displays the current tasks in your to-do list, or informs you if the list is empty.

   - **3. Quit:** Exits the application.

7. Use the options to manage your tasks as follows:

   - To add a task, choose option 1, enter the task's description, and it will be added to your to-do list.

   - To view your tasks, choose option 2, and the application will display your to-do list.

   - To quit the application, choose option 3, and the application will terminate.

## Customization

You can customize this script to fit your needs and preferences. Here are some ways to make changes:

- **Modify the Task Data Structure**: You can modify the data structure used for tasks. For example, you could add additional attributes to tasks (e.g., due date, priority, etc.) or use a more complex data structure like dictionaries.

- **Enhance the User Interface**: You can improve the user interface by adding more descriptive messages, error handling, or additional functionality.

- **Data Persistence**: To make your tasks persist between runs, consider saving them to a file and loading them when the application starts.

- **Extended Features**: You can extend the functionality by allowing users to mark tasks as completed, edit tasks, set priorities, or categorize tasks.
