# Basic Calculator

This is a simple Python console-based calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It allows you to enter two numbers and choose an operation to perform. You can also quit the application when you're done with your calculations.

## How to Use

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

2. Download the `calculator.py` script.

3. Open your terminal or command prompt.

4. Navigate to the directory where the `calculator.py` script is located.

5. Run the script by entering the following command:

   ```shell
   python calculator.py
   ```

6. You will see the main menu with the following options:

   - **1. Add:** Allows you to add two numbers.

   - **2. Subtract:** Allows you to subtract one number from another.

   - **3. Multiply:** Allows you to multiply two numbers.

   - **4. Divide:** Allows you to divide one number by another. Note that dividing by zero is not allowed, and the application will handle this error.

   - **5. Quit:** Exits the application.

7. Use the options to perform calculations as follows:

   - Choose the operation you want to perform by entering the corresponding option number (1, 2, 3, or 4).

   - Enter the first number when prompted.

   - Enter the second number when prompted.

   - The application will display the result of the chosen operation.

   - To quit the application, choose option 5, and the application will terminate.

## Customization

This script is a basic calculator for educational and illustrative purposes. You can customize and extend it to suit your needs and preferences. Here are some ways to make changes:

- **Additional Operations**: You can add more operations such as exponentiation, square root, or other mathematical functions.
