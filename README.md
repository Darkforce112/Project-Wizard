## Contributing

We welcome contributions from engineering graduates who are passionate about open source projects. Here's how you can contribute:

1. Upload your project files to the relevant language folders.

2. Create a separate folder for your project with the main program file named `main.__` and include any other necessary data files.

3. Ensure that your program is executable on various systems. If specific versions are required, please mention them in the project files.

4. Provide a `requirements.txt` file if your project depends on specific modules or packages.

5. If your project passes our tests and is deemed valuable, your pull request will be accepted.

6. Full guide on how to contribute is available [Contribution](Contribution.md) ~ Typo corrected by [Chaitanya](https://github.com/Chaitanya110703) Thanks!
